This is a quick bash and octave project to produce videos of the scattering of phonons from the output of Radiative3D.

Capture the Radiative3D output into a file.  

Use the bash scripts to preprocess the data.  

Use the Octave script to produce the framecache (collection of still frames)

Use ffmpeg to make a movie.
