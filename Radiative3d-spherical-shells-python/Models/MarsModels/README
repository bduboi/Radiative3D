Appendix B for "Seismology on Mars: an analysis of direct, reflected and converted seismic body waves with implications for interior structure" by Duran et al.

This folder contains seismic velocity models of Mars obtained using the geophysical method, as shown in Figure 17 of the article. 

Geophysical_models: The "geophysical" inversion, fitting differential travel times, receiver functions, MoI and mean density

All models are in the nd format, which is readable by TauP.

NOTE: For reasons of compatibility with TauP, each model file has a tiny inner core. This inner core is not a result of the inversion. Lower mantle Vp structure is not constrained by seismic data.
