This folder contains auto-generated code that facilitiates build-time
compile options for the Radiative3D project.  This autogenerated code
comes in the form of:

1) Tiny include files that get included somewhere in the mainline
   code.  These code "option" files are named opt-*.hpp.

2) Tiny files that embed compiler flags that should be used at
   build-time. These could set, eg, debug, optimization, or warning
   settings.  These files are named: cc-*.hpp

You should not need to create or edit these files. They are generated
by the Makefile in the directory above.

Subversion is directed to ignore thes files via the svn:ignore
property, so they won't clutter up your svn status output. Neither
should they be added to the repo.  To view/edit this property, use:

  svn propget svn:ignore .
  svn propedit svn:ignore .
