// CLASS:   ProbDist
//
//   Encapsulates a probability distribution, or an array of
//   non-negative numbers used to establish the relative probability
//   of a set of discrete, indexed elements.  Provides also a set of
//   methods useful for randomly selecting an index from the set.
//
//   STORAGE: Numerical probabilities are stored one of two different
//   ways, with a boolean member encoding the storage method.  The
//   class will of its own accord switch between the storage methods
//   depending on which representation suits a desired action.  The
//   two representations are (1) differential and (2) accumulated, aka
//   integrated.  If the representation is differential, then the
//   elements of the array contain the relative probility of occurence
//   of the element.  If the representation is integrated, then the
//   elements of the array contain the cumulative sum of relative
//   probability as the array index increases.  The differential
//   representation is typically used for population the distribution,
//   and the integrated representation is used for randomly selecting
//   an index (since the random chooser requires this form).  Usually,
//   the ProbDist object begins life in differential form and then
//   switches to integral form when the first method that requires
//   that form is called.
//
//   NORMALIZATION: The numerical values stored in the arrays are NOT
//   normalized, meaning (equivalently) that the sum of the
//   differential values, and the final integrated value, are not
//   necessarily unitary. (Ie, might not sum to 1).  This is intended
//   design, and the implication is that when code-users set
//   individual probability elements, they are setting RELATIVE
//   probability weights, and not necessarily absolute (normalized)
//   probabilities. This means the distribution will have some
//   "magnitude," and that that magnitude will be accessible to the
//   user as it may presumably be of some use to the user.  The
//   chooser methods, which select an element index at random, will
//   scale appropriately and function as expected regardless of this
//   magnitude.
//
//   TERMINOLOGY: "[Relative] Probability Weight" will refer to the
//   un-normalized probability of a particular single element.
//   "Differential Probability" will refer to the normalized
//   probability of a particular single element.  The Probability
//   Weights (PW) and the Differential Probabilities (DP) stand in the
//   relation PW = Magnitude * DP.  "Cumulative Probability" will
//   refer to the sum of the Probability Weight of a particular
//   element and all elements with lower indices than the particular
//   element.  Cumulative Probabilities are NOT normalized.  There is
//   at present no adopted terminology for normalized cumulative
//   probability as there is at present no use case for it.
