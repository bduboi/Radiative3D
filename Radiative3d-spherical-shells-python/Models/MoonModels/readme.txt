Previously published lunar internal structure models and the ones of ISSI team (ISSI_MOON_M?.nd)
All models are provided in Named Discontinuity seismological format (*.nd).
File Moon_Quakes_location_published.xlsx also provides the quake locations previously publised and used in figures 6 and 7 of the study.

Please note the following points:
- ISSI_MOON_M?.nd models are median values of model ensembles. The crust/mantle interface is arbitrarily indicated into ISSI_MOON_M1.nd and ISSI_MOON_M3.nd models in order to allow most of the seismological codes reading these files to find this interface. However, this interface is not defined in M1 models, and varying into M3 models
- the velocities in GilletMargerin_attenuation_2016.nd models are not consrained, but the P and S quality factors are.
